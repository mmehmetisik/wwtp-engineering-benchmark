# 🤝 Contributing to WWTP Engineering Benchmark

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This benchmark grows stronger with community input.

## 🎯 How You Can Contribute

### 1. Propose New Tasks

Have a challenging WWTP scenario that would test LLM reasoning? We'd love to hear it!

**Good tasks have:**
- ✅ A realistic scenario from actual plant operations
- ✅ Multiple plausible answers (one clearly correct)
- ✅ A "trap" that catches models lacking field experience
- ✅ Clear evaluation criteria

**To propose a task:**
1. Open an [Issue](../../issues/new)
2. Use the title format: `[NEW TASK] Your Task Name`
3. Include:
   - Scenario description
   - Multiple choice options (A, B, C, D, E)
   - Correct answer with explanation
   - Why this tests real expertise (the "trap")

---

### 2. Test Additional Models

Run the benchmark on models not yet in the leaderboard.

**To submit results:**
1. Run all 10 tasks on your model
2. Record pass/fail for each task
3. Open an [Issue](../../issues/new) with title: `[RESULTS] Model Name`
4. Include: Model name, version, scores, and any observations

---

### 3. Improve Documentation

Found a typo? Have a better explanation? PRs welcome!

---

### 4. Share Your Experience

Are you a WWTP operator or engineer? Your field insights are valuable!

- Share scenarios where AI gave dangerous advice
- Suggest knowledge gaps you've observed
- Help validate task accuracy

## ⚠️ Guidelines

- **Safety First:** Tasks should never encourage unsafe practices
- **Real Experience:** Scenarios should come from actual operations, not textbooks
- **Clear Answers:** One answer must be definitively correct
- **No Ambiguity:** Avoid "it depends" situations
